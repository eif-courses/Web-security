If you find web page with high priority risks first lecture you get bonus <strong>10 </strong>point to your final evaluation. 
- Run A Windows Web development environment for Apache, MySQL, PHP databases and try to launch http://localhost:8888 if it working try to find wwww/ directory and add new webpage named myFirstPage.php, open that file and add simple code line <?php echo 'hello world!!!' ?> if everythis is fine and browser open your web page with text hello world !!! then you are ready to do next tasks.

- Using Windows operating system run command prompt add your wget tool path to installed wget bin directory cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin".  
- Try to run wget tool enter command cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin"
wget.exe --help read instructions and try to do some tasks. 
- Download any webpage source code using WGET tool. Finally write to text document summary what you learn to do using this tool.  

___
### 5 TASK (10 points)
___

- Create myFunction.php then create own unique function which secure against XSS attacks (do no use default libraries functions e.g. htmlentities()). 
- You should think how to ignore special characters in input fields, also your should implement data validation function.
- When you prepeare to show your created unique function you should have some prepeared testing data for your myFunction.php input fields.

___
